 1. MATLAB 2024b and KERAS 2.10.0 are used for FLE and TLE seizure detection in this work. The MATLAB code primarily comprises three functional modules: (1) data preprocessing (including filtering and normalization), (2) sample generation, and (3) result visualization. The Python code exclusively handles model training and testing procedures.
 2. Only analysis code is provided in this folder; clinical FLE/TLE data are not included due to privacy/ethical restrictions
